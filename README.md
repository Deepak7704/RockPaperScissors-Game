Rock Paper Scissors is a simple and fun game that can be played by two people. The game is based on the following rules:

- Each player chooses one of three possible gestures: rock, paper, or scissors.
- The gestures are compared according to the following logic:
    - Rock beats scissors, because rock can smash scissors.
    - Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper.
    - Paper beats rock, because paper can wrap rock.
    - If both players choose the same gesture, it is a tie and the game is repeated.
- The player who wins the most rounds out of a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.
